Define a function named "toUpper" which accepts a String as input parameter that is then
formatted to upper case as output.

def toUpper(s:String) = { s.toUpperCase } // By using simple function;

Define another function named "toLower" which accepts a String as input parameter and
formats the input to lower case as output.

def toLower(s:String) =s.toLowerCase // By using simple function;

Define another function named "formatNames" which also has an input String called
"name". This function however has another parameter which accepts functions with an
input of type String and also outputs a String. This particular function will be used to apply
the given format to the "name" input.
You can use the test inputs for say, "Scala", "Spark", and "BigData", and make sure that the
output is as shown below.

def formatNames (name:String,f:String=>String) = {
println(f(name))
}
val lt=List("Scala","Spark","BigData")
for (i <- lt) {
if (i !="Spark") {formatNames(i,toUpper) 
}else {
formatNames(i,toLower) 
}
}

formatNames("spark",toLower)
formatNames("BIGDATA",toUpper)
